## Things that are done
- web API integration:  Nodejs is used to create a mock server for the webAPI. Please use the following cmd to start the server at PORT=8000. Make sure `PORT=8000` is written in the .env file.
```
NodeJS:
~ npm start

Angular
~ ng serve
```
- Search by price, rating and provider name
- Sort by price and rating
- Feature to download ISP details as JPG
- Link are using target=_blank
- Social media integration as tweeter tweet message
- Fully responsive design


Note:
- I have tried to use angular material in the code but due to design limitation much was not possible. Also some icons may appear different due to icon unavailability
- No comments have been made in the code due to time limitation but I have tried to put as much functionality in the code as possible.
- A child router has been used to show the provider details.
- Accessibility improveents have not been done due to time limitations
